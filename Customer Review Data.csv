"1. Service call was to replace a riser from meter to anchor that had been ripped off the wall when a tree fell on the line by an earlier storm, partly restored by a contract worker.  So the National Grid appointment was arranged by the Electrician.   National Grid was needed both to disconnect before the work and reconnect afterward.  National Grid arrived on time to disconnect at 08:30.  The electrician's work was done (in the rain) by 13:15, and the inspector came and put his sticker on it by 14:00.  After that we did not receive any indication when National Grid might arrive to reconnect afterward, except the electrician had said to call him if they had not arrived by 6pm.  We had turned on the generator and started preparing supper, when they arrived just a few minutes before 6pm.  

It would have been nice to have gotten a message National Grid indicating when they expected to reconnect the line, as we had to stop and turn off the generator for them to do the work.  (The generator was right at the location of the work and was too loud for the workers to hear each other talk.)  But I understand cell phone service is not available in many areas around here.

2. As to the work itself, the electrician had left three possible anchors: the black temporary anchor left by the contract worker when the tree fell on the line, the original large ceramic anchor under a high eave at a hip roof corner, and a new lower small anchor under a side eave not in the snow fall line.  (The electrician was worried the high anchor might not be acceptable to National Grid because a little snow could come off the hip roof onto it.  But at the hip roof corner it was very little snow off a few inches of roof.) In the rain, the National Grid worker initially was reinstalling the line on the temporary black anchor, and after he had done part of the work I recognized what he was doing and asked him to move it to the original high anchor.  (The temporary anchor was pulling out nails holding the side rafter.  The worker felt he could wiggle the low anchor so it was not screwed into a solid enough beam.)  

Maybe the worker could have asked or said what he was doing so that I could have objected earlier.  Then he would not have had to undo his work reattaching the line to the black temporary anchor.  He did so courteously, so it was not a big problem, just a little hitch that could have gone better.",4,Connect/Turn On,Mixed,4,Glens Falls,MICHAEL NACCARATO,December 2024,12/25/2024 11:41:37 PM,"Tuesday, December 17, 2024"

"A new gas meter installed,  old one must have had issues.  Furnace relit instantly, and seemingly runs smoother because of better gas flow.  The National Grid guy was perfectly upfront discussing this replacement.  I was worried about shutting our old Furnace off in January, but now all is functioning as necessary. 
However, this brings to our forefront a needed Furnace upgrade to a new direct vent system. 
Thanks

A new meter was installed by national grid on 12.19.23 because family danz could net get a high enough pressure during installation of a new heating system. I finally called in March because recent bills only showed an estimated reading. I was given an 8-4 window on March 26 and told that I had to be home and the tech would call with a 15 minute notice to check the meter. I called at noon and was told the tech had already checked the outside meter unbeknownst to me....I was home and did not see or hear him. Your 800 #told me the techs notes indicated the brand new 12.19.23 meter is not working properly and will need to be replaced..SO NO CALL BEFORE YOUR 3.26 VISIT WHILE I WAS HOME AND NO INDICATION OF WHEN A NEW METER WILL BE INSTALLED.

"As part of a two-unit condominium, neither we nor our neighbor have had functional meters for months. It took six months for National Grid to come out once they realized the meters weren't reading. When the technicians showed up, they shut off both services because we were ""receiving free gas"" since the meters were not installed properlyâa problem that is 100% due to National Grid's initial installationâand they said they were not authorized to fix the meters or switch our services back on. The technicians were going to leave us without gas and move onto another job, but I had to basically beg them to stay to ensure that someone from National Grid would, in fact, be coming to fix the meters and turn our services back on. Someone finally showed up and supposedly fixed the meters and switched our services back on. However, I learned from our neighbor that when he got home, his service was still switched off, and it took National Grid three days to come and switch his gas back on.

"Because the problem was not what a previous National Grid field rep diagnosed the rep was rude and discourteous and coming across as the issue was my own stupidity and he was inconvenienced doing his job.  Moved into my current apartment and did not have gas, previously a field rep came looked at my stove and checked whatever he checks and told me that due to not having access to the basement and my statements of receiving multiple bills for several previous tenants he felt the meter had been pinned and to call and arrange another appointment between National Grid and the management company to gain access to the basement and unpin the meter.  The problem turned out to be that the management company had not turned the gas on for the stove. An unfortunate error on the part of both National Grid and the mangement company and found the last field rep's attitude and demeanor offensive and insulting.

Scared my girlfriend and the neighbors had them believing they were going to die from this supposed gas leak that doesn't exist. And when he left, he forgot to shut our neighbors back door, almost resulting in their dog escaping.",,Time,Very Negative,1,Schenectady,AUSTIN SIERS,May 2024,5/17/2024 12:28:40 PM,"Thursday, May 16, 2024"

I get a letter from you telling me that you need to call about a problem reading the meter.  I called the number and was told trouble reading the meter.  That a new smart device needed to be installed.  Quick transfer to the smart reader representative.  She told me that the last person I spoke to was wrong.  That there was an inspection hold on the account or something like that.   That I needed to contact someone else about that.  I told her that I have no idea what she is talking about.  I spoke to two representatives about this.  I told her to feel free to figure out whatever needs to be figured out. I told her that the meter is right there on the side of the building and I was happy to meet someone there if necessary.  She told me that if I didn't do more then I will be penalized.

I had received an email from you stating you had received my email and not to send another form/email.
No-one called me to advise me regarding my request. So, I assumed you had resolved the matter. 
Now. after almost a year, you had emailed me that you'll have an unit placed on LOFT for the tenant who left. 
First of all, I had sold the building and I don't own it since March 2024.
I had called National Grid and discussed the issue. I was advised to write and explain the situation in an email.
Despite the attempts to correct the matter, the issue was not fixed.

"I had four visits to fix a gas meter, which was not providing NationalGrid with readings for 2.5 years. The first one, the service person didn't replace the meter (just a battery or something to that effect). The seond visit was called because the gas meter was not changed, the service person said he didn't need to and it should work. I asked is there a way to test this before he left (as I already took off 2 days for the visits). He replied saying you'll find out next billing cycle. The third visit was a no-show due to internal NationalGrid mistakes - the order was not put in right by a customer service rep, so the dispatchers had it scheduled for the next day. Again, I took off the of work for the no-show. Then the service guy came in for a fourth visit. He remembered me, was apologetic, and changed out the meter.

"I had just closed on this particular home 1 day prior to National Grid's emergency visit. (I term it emergency because that's how National Grid considered it; not a word I would have used, but it turns out that there were gas leaks in the home, so I guess emergency is somewhat of a proper word in this case.) National Grid's visit was not planned (not that I know of, anyway). I put in a request to have the power switched over from the former home owner's name into my name. Thought that was going to be done remotely. I guess it is done on site (???) When they arrived on site and found the gas leaks, they tried contacting me via phone, but I wasn't reachable. The tech (or techs) did enter my home through an open window. Upon entering my property the following day, I was a bit unnerved and quite surprised to see my basement light was on (I know I didn't leave it on myself the previous day when I was there) and I saw 2 ceiling tiles in my basement down, (on the floor). So, I am grateful for National Grid taking care of the issue on site, if that's what needed to in fact be done, but I wish they had remembered to turn my lights off and put the ceiling tiles back into place, because I didn't have any clue as to who was in my home (that I had just started to move into 1 day prior to this surprise visit).",,Customer Service,Negative,3,Schenectady,MATTHEW SWANN,August 2024,8/30/2024 7:14:43 AM,"Friday, August 23, 2024"

"I had multiple representative tell me I was scheduled for a certain date and to remain onsite. By the third representative they told me the work order had not been submitted properly and that the technicians did not work weekends and the next appointment they had was 5 days from then. I began to complain and the representative transferred me to another rep who told me the previous rep must not have wanted to deal with the situation. I was then scheduled for the next available date and sent a conformation email all to be notified the technician was not coming out that day either. I then had to complain to get the representative to contact dispatch and add me as an ""add on"" I had to rent an airbnb and two hotels because my home did not have power when National Grid said it would on multiple occasions.

Anyone I spoke to told me I have to keep calling back then so they get somebody that can come after 3:30. I asked them if they could put it on the ticket And originally I was told no I argued it. The woman finally said OK Iâll put it on the ticket. On that date that I got itâs a good thing. I have the ring doorbell because the guy came at 1 PM. I told him through the ring that nobody will be home until 330. I explained that nobodyâs gonna be home any day at a week and that I asked the woman to please put on the ticket after 3:30. So the guy said I get off at 3:30 so it would have to be overtime. Then he looked at the back of the ticket And he laughed. I guess he thinks itâs funny and said oh hereâs where it says after 3:30 so he left I had to call make another appointment. Iâm trying my best to get them in there so I asked for November 29 and I would take the day off to be there requested 7 AM to 1 PM was told OK the 29th came and went nobody showed up. I called again on Monday and I was told it got declined because thatâs a holiday for their employees for the holiday was the day before on the 28th so now I took a day for absolutely nothing Explain this to the woman and asked to speak to a supervisor. I got a phone call back from a field supervisor who told me heâs got a guy that will show up after 3:30.

"I had to keep calling to make an appointment. The first time they came , there was no notification they were coming. I had to call and make an appointment.

"I have no complaints about my recent visit, but I do want to note that it was unnecessarily burdensome to schedule. Per the instructions in a voicemail I received, I called national grid to schedule a meter change in January. I waited on hold for over an hour and after speaking to a representative about scheduling, I received confirmation of an appointment day and time. The person scheduled that day never showed up and gave no notice of the need to cancel or reschedule, which was incredibly frustrating given that I took the day off and sat at home waiting for them to show up. After having been no showed for that visit I started receiving multiple calls per day from national grid again and after dozens of calls a voicemail finally offered the option to schedule online, which I did for this appointment. The whole process wouldâve been so much easier if I had a human call to schedule the meter change instead of an automated message or if I had been given the online link to schedule in the first place.",1,Billing,Very Negative,4,Boston,,March 2025,3/20/2025 12:13:33 PM,"Wednesday, March 19, 2025"

I waited on hold for over an hour and after speaking to a representative about scheduling, I received confirmation of an appointment day and time. The person scheduled that day never showed up and gave no notice of the need to cancel or reschedule, which was incredibly frustrating given that I took the day off and sat at home waiting for them to show up. After having been no showed for that visit I started receiving multiple calls per day from national grid again and after dozens of calls a voicemail finally offered the option to schedule online, which I did for this appointment.

"I must clarify.  I had many phone calls with National Grid.  I do not recall how the last one went but it was probably okay as I was finally able to sell my deceased mom's house.  I was left with a house that had open applications and had to work with plumbers, electricians and public utility services.  And I had to do this while I live in California.  So many people, told me so many different things, that the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing.  I wrote down notes and names.  But I will say some of the people were very nice, we confirmed appointments and when they didn't show up, I had to call National Grid.  The last call I remember vividly is with a Mr. Solis (sp?) when I explained I had two service calls in the same day and that didn't happen.  I told him who I spoke with and asked to speak with a supervisor.  I know I was not rude but I didn't give it up either.  The next thing I know, I am back in the que waiting for my turn.  Please explain to your employees that when that is done, it is essentially hanging up on a person.  So if I had a choice of dealing with National Grid again or having open heart surgery without anesthesia, I'd do with the open heart surgery.

"I purchased a home on 11/2/23.  I call the previous Monday to have service transferred to my name as of that date.  I went to do the walk through Wednesday prior to the closing, and there was no power to the house.   Apparently the seller called after I did that and told you to turn service off instead of transferring it to me.  So I immediately called National Grid on Thursday morning at 7.  The woman I spoke with said she would send someone out on that Friday between 10-12.  I had to be at the house because it is gas and electric.   Nobody showed.  I called them on Friday afternoon and a different representative told me they would schedule me for 11/7 between 8 - 4.  I called the day before to confirm this, and then a totally different representative told me that there was nothing scheduled for 11/7, as someone in the office ""must have looked at the wrong screen"" and saw that it had electricity so they put it in for a transfer.  So because I was told that they were not coming on the 7th, I was not expecting any phone call.  Apparently, a technician called from a blocked number (so I couldn't call back), at 8 a.m.   I did not hear or see this call coming in.  So, apparently the electricity came back on on 11/7, but I still have no gas to heat the house or the hot water.  I have an elderly aunt who is moving in next week and this has to be done.  They tell me that I will get a call to meet a technician on Monday the 13th to turn the gas on.  I am not feeling very hopeful.   As the representative I spoke with told me National Grid created two separate accounts which is why this all got messed up.  They also told me that Monday the 13th was the earliest they could possibly get there.   First, after November 1st in upstate NY is cold, and by law you have to turn everything on within 5 business days.   I do have my attorney who is aware of all of this.   I also know how you guys do business.   You send a technician out to do something for a set amount of time, for example, an hour and half, and they get the job done in 15 minutes so they sit on their asses for the rest of the time doing nothing.  A perfect example of this was right outside my office at work.   I could see them.  They finished their job, and sat there for hours.  So I am currently highly dissatisfied with National Grid.   If my heat does not get turned on by November 13th, I will have my lawyer involved.  I am calling every day until Monday to make sure this is scheduled for the 13th.    I find this very unprofessional, and surprising.   I've never had issues with you before.   Customer service tried to get a manager for me, but nobody was available.  I had them take my number down to have a manager call me back (twice) and to this day I have heard nothing.

The woman I spoke with said she would send someone out on that Friday between 10-12.  I had to be at the house because it is gas and electric.   Nobody showed.  I called them on Friday afternoon and a different representative told me they would schedule me for 11/7 between 8 - 4.  I called the day before to confirm this, and then a totally different representative told me that there was nothing scheduled for 11/7, as someone in the office ""must have looked at the wrong screen"" and saw that it had electricity so they put it in for a transfer.  So because I was told that they were not coming on the 7th, I was not expecting any phone call.  Apparently, a technician called from a blocked number (so I couldn't call back), at 8 a.m.   I did not hear or see this call coming in.  So, apparently the electricity came back on on 11/7, but I still have no gas to heat the house or the hot water.  I have an elderly aunt who is moving in next week and this has to be done.  They tell me that I will get a call to meet a technician on Monday the 13th to turn the gas on.  I am not feeling very hopeful.   As the representative I spoke with told me National Grid created two separate accounts which is why this all got messed up.  They also told me that Monday the 13th was the earliest they could possibly get there.   First, after November 1st in upstate NY is cold, and by law you have to turn everything on within 5 business days.   I do have my attorney who is aware of all of this.   I also know how you guys do business.   You send a technician out to do something for a set amount of time, for example, an hour and half, and they get the job done in 15 minutes so they sit on their asses for the rest of the time doing nothing.  A perfect example of this was right outside my office at work.   I could see them.  They finished their job, and sat there for hours.  So I am currently highly dissatisfied with National Grid.   If my heat does not get turned on by November 13th, I will have my lawyer involved.  I am calling every day until Monday to make sure this is scheduled for the 13th.    I find this very unprofessional, and surprising.   I've never had issues with you before.   Customer service tried to get a manager for me, but nobody was available.  I had them take my number down to have a manager call me back (twice) and to this day I have heard nothing.

I rated dissatisfied because  i waited 3 days for them to turn on my gas because first time they change the appointment to the next day and not letting me until I called to ask if anyone will be coming and then they told me the day change to the next Day. Then on the next day I called back 2 times for that Day and the said yes someone will be there  and nobody called or showed up. On the next day when I called and tell them that the day before I was waiting the whole day and nobody call that they come the representative said that she saw that they left a note that the knock at the door which I think was a LIE because nobody call me to said that they are coming and I was home all day that day. So the representative said till the next week Thursday  which was 1 more week I had to wait but I said to her that if someone wasn't supose to call that they are coming because every time I called they are making sure that they have my number to call when they are coming. Also I mentioned that the place is getting cold and I have to wait a whole week which wasn't my fault I was home all day waiting for them to come and they never show up to come turn on the gas. So she said for me to wait that she will speak to her supervisor and she came on back and told me the next day someone will come and then the next day they came and turn on the gas. It was very frustrating calling so many time hearing they will send someone put and just waiting waiting on them and couldn't go nowhere because I had to be home for them to come and they never come.,,Connect/Turn On,Very Negative,2,Schenectady,BRANDON BURKHARDT,October 2024,10/7/2024 1:25:20 PM,"Friday, October 4, 2024"

I called your call center back in November of 2023 to follow up on the second gas leak reported in September . The woman on the phone insisted on sending a tech again and told me to stay home. That tech told me that they have a year to fix the second gas leak reported in September .. sooo with that being said , your people decided to come Saturday 7/20 to fix this issue but guess what? I wasnât home so they shut off my gas and because of their âeasementâ broke into my backyard. One of your workers I have on camera sitting on top of my plastic garbage shed with his full body weight . This garbage sheds hydraulics that keep the garbage open no longer work so I will be filing a claim for $228 and change.

My statement online still illustrates an estimated bill which is extremely high for me which leads me to believe no one was actually here.  So what could they do differently?  Call and let me know when they are coming if they actually are, and leave evidence and and explanation if they were actually here.  This situation has been on going since the end of March, I have called weekly and not seen a resolution.  The only difference is the installation of a smart meter.  If you can't resolve this I would like my old meter back.  My account is about to get dinged for a bill of over $400.  You can see my billing history.

We were never notified a tech was coming out. If we were called, my roommate could have been there in 5 mins. My property manager called multiple times without getting help. He also could have been at the house quickly. On the 3rd day of this going on, without heat, I was told a tech would be out the next day and would call me 30mins before getting there. That rep was rude considering I could not move into my new apt, that I was paying rent for, but because is was not deemed an âemergencyâ it didnât matter to get someone out same day.  Again no call from the tech, like I was told. Clearly having a monopoly on the area means customer service isnât a priority. The company will get their money anyways because customers are over a barrel having to use you. When I move next, I will be sure to look at places that do not use National Grid. My first experience with the company, and I went without heat for days while my apartment was unlivable. You should be ashamed of the service I experienced.

"I was told service people would be here between 1:00 and 3:00 and that they wanted someone to be at home.

Not seeing anyone, I called National Grid at 2:45 to see if anyone was coming.  I was told that someone HAD been here, and the case had been moved to the line department or something.

"I was told to expect a call from installer prior to their arrival between 8 and 4, and that I had to answer the call or theyâd leave and Iâd have to reschedule having the power/gas turned on. I had my phone at the ready but, because cellphones (I have an iPhone) do not ring if the number calling is not in my contacts or comes up as an Unknown Caller, so I missed the two calls the installer made and panicked (I wasnât at the installation site, a friend was to be there). The panic was awful as I tried to make contact with customer service the second Iâd realized Iâd missed the calls. Through dumb luck (because calling National Grid and getting an actual human to talk to is very difficult) after two calls I reached the right department and that person could confirm the installers were there working, as my friend had arrived by chance at the house).

"In this review I am combining feedback of my two recent service visits:

1. A crew came out Friday 3/29 at about 6PM EDT to investigate irregular voltages experienced outside of the house at the meter. Damage to the neutral in the underground feed was identified, we were informed that power would not be restored until the issue was fixed, they took the meter and left. We were not given any documentation of the visit or problem written in person or email. I called the customer service number multiple times and was denied any documentation even though there was clearly history of the service visit. This made it INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT to engage with my insurance provider for coverage of the replacement. I still do not know if they are satisfied with what I gave to them. National Grid should, without being prompted, always follow up with customers in writing. In addition, we were not offered any temporary power restoration options even though winter weather was still present. We were left without heat for 10 days and we're lucky no pipes froze.

2. When restoring power on Monday 4/8 I had to wait at the house with no power or heat for roughly 6-7 hours because I was not given an estimated time of arrival or even a window. I didn't want to risk not being there when they arrived because there was no guarantee that they would even try to call me if they needed me, and I couldn't bear the thought of delaying another day. The whole process is very disorganized and left me even more stressed after a week and a half of stress. Other than that, the tech did his job and was friendly, no issue with him.

I feel as though there was absolutely no respect for us through this entire process. Our entire lives were upended for a week and a half because we wanted to resolve a safety issue at our house. We were left to figure it out and you guys couldn't even be bothered to just help us coordinate with our insurance to cover the sudden cost, let alone help us figure out how to heat our house in 30-40 degree weather.

"In this review I am combining feedback of my two recent service visits:

1. A crew came out Friday 3/29 at about 6PM EDT to investigate irregular voltages experienced outside of the house at the meter. Damage to the neutral in the underground feed was identified, we were informed that power would not be restored until the issue was fixed, they took the meter and left. We were not given any documentation of the visit or problem written in person or email. I called the customer service number multiple times and was denied any documentation even though there was clearly history of the service visit. This made it INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT to engage with my insurance provider for coverage of the replacement. I still do not know if they are satisfied with what I gave to them. National Grid should, without being prompted, always follow up with customers in writing.

"Itâs was no fault of the technician, but we had NO idea our service was being shut off. I called to inform National Grid we were selling the property. I was told someone would come to do a final meter read. I was asked when the closing was and no one was available that day but was available 4 days prior. That seemed fine. At no time did the rep on the phone inform me the service would be shut off. Eversource does not shut your service off when property sells. No one informed me to have to new owners call either and set up a new account. This would have been very helpful. If someone is selling a property the rep on the phone should make it crystal clear the new owners should be calling as well so service is NOT disconnected.

"Its not the rep's fault but I did not receive any information on why the problem exists. I've lived in a house I built for 2.5 years and have NEVER had an actual reading although my bill indicates I have. The rep said there's nothing wrong with the meter and no one knows why this is occurring. Who knows if I've been over or under paying all this time because of ""estimated"" readings or when or if I'll ever find out. What guarantee is there that I'll ever have an actual reading???? This is frustrating. When I first addressed this issue I asked to speak to a supervisor and wasn't allowed to. I was given conflicting information. No one has reached out to me to offer any kind of explanation or remedy for this. The field rep was great so it's not his fault but all he did was take an actual reading to send in. There was no other action taken so I have to assume that the problem still exists.  This is unacceptable. I need someone to call me. 5183761448. Thank you.

"My landlord's father showed up (from Connecticut which is about 2.5 hours drive to my residence) at the time of the service appointment without ever notifying me that he was coming. It looked like at 10+ minutes confrontation by him with your technician. When the technicians entered my home they denied any confrontation and said it was just a conversation, but they didn't share any of the dialogue with me, only that he was here to represent his son. It is my opinion that the landlord's dad had no business being here, doing a surprise appearance without any communication to inform me of such.

"Nothing about working with National Grid was easy.

2. When I tried to make another appointment, the rep said the meter people are the ones who could help me and then transferred me to the emergency services, who did not help me.
3. The emergency service person on the phone, Jeremy, was rude and told me he noted everything he said in the file lest I think he was lying to me. he told me to call customer service. Customer service were the ones who transferred me to emergency services.
4. I called customer services back and spoke to a supervisor, Martha, who scheduled someone to come and look at the meter next week, Tuesday 4-10, between 8-10am. I hope they come. Martha was helpful and courteous.
What could have done to improve?  A. Given me the correct help the first time I called. B. Come on 4-4 when you said you would.

The technician couldnât fix it so it is now on us to pay for its repair and waste yet more time waiting for it.   3 days wasted due to national grid! Thanks! Great job! Your customer service is the worst of any company I have ever dealt with. I spent an hour on  the phone before I was able to talk a human. The second attempt ended with me waiting 2 hours and 45 minutes for a callback which occurred at 515 p.m.  your automated system is rude and quite literally useless.

The field agent who turned my power back on was great.  The hold times to actually speak with someone and get an appointment to turn my power on was a NIGHTMARE.

I called 3 separate times and was on hold for over an hour each time.  That is 100% unacceptable and no business should run or stay in business if management doesn't address the obvious issues with that.

"The installer pulled the box the unit was installed with away from the building. He gave me a card of an electrician and told me to give him a call (assuredly at my expense). I did not call. Rather, I called National Grid about it.  I was told, since the backer board on the house may need to be replaced, that it was my problem and that I should arrange for a contractor to fix it, again at my expense. I pushed back and National Grid is sending someone out to refasten the box. Iâm not sure that will be enough, the board may need to be replaced as well.

"The problem the tech was here for was due to a widespread service outage that blew out literally many power meters in the area. 
I had my meter replaced within an hour and a half of that happening. I assume many others had theirs replaced during the rest of the day and a couple days after.

The issue was caused by the new meter numbers not being registered to the customers. Therefore, all of our electric bills had been estimated since the January outage. Nobody knows what their true bills are at this time.

In regards to the visit, I called immediately after getting a warning letter stating that multiple attempts had been made to get to the meter. And that's bullshit, because I am retired and home 98% of the time. I have cameras. Nobody approached or attempted to do anything yet.

As for the appointment, the phone rep told me the appointment time was a window between 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.

The tech arrived at 12:00 p.m., just as I was about to go walk my dogs. He stated that his service schedule showed between 12:00 and 5:00 p.m. 

I wrote down the appointment while I was on the phone, and I had multiple reminder entries into my phone calendar.

The AMR and meter numbers should have been synced at the time of installation. On my town and village Facebook page, many people are angry and upset that they're billing is either incorrect or high, and some stated that they got the same letter that I got.

As for the question on ""was I satisfied or not?"", I checked ""not applicable"", because this was a situation that should not have happened. It's not whether or not I am satisfied, I just expect things to get corrected if they were not done completely or correctly the first time.

On the two prior attempts NG refused to install the meter because of deficiencies in the plumbing.  There is a lot of confusion between NG and the plumber as to who is responsible for what.  NG should coordinate better with plumbers.  Especially in this case Burner King who is a NG authorized plumber. On visits #1 and #2 NG each time added more plumbing requirements.  A lot of time could have been saved if the first NG installer would have provided the complete requirement.  If I was given the survey to complete after visits #1 and #2 my rating would have been 'highly dissatisfied'. Also since this was an oil to gas conversion, NG was here a few months earlier and did an ""investigation"" where they rated all the gas appliances in the house.  None of the meter installers had the results of that investigation, which determines the size of the meter needed, so each time they redid the survey.  For the entire process NG wasted a lot of my time. NG is not efficient at all.",,Billing,Very Negative,5, Hewlett,"POLIMENI, MICHAEL",February 2024,2/24/2024 2:00:00 AM,"Tuesday, February 20, 2024"

"The representative was very rude, did not actually do an investigation, did not address any of my concerns, and made up their mind after a minute (but stayed much longer, wasting my time). 
The representative spoke with the maintenance person (who represented the Landlords) before coming into the apartment and after leaving. I don't know what they told them, but they weren't truthful when we were together.

Your rep did not attempt to investigate the other meters and showed up at a time where the neighbors wouldn't be using all of their devices as it was the middle of a workday.

National grid writes down devices that are in the home, even if they are disconnected. If a person has 10 vacuum cleaners, does that mean they're going to run all 10 at the same time? You need to also consider if a person works from home, is single, married, with children (how many TVs can a single person watch at a time?). I had a room that is completely sealed off. They still took down the heater's measurements.

I was told that I'll get a really silly letter saying that I have the POETENTIAL to use a lot of electricity. Sure, every house does. A person can run a heater and AC at the same time, great. But my main complaint was that I wasn't home for MONTHS and got charged hundreds of killowatt hours, more than what is physically possible. Someone is stealing electricity and charging my meter.

You take very careful measurements of if a lightbulb is 8 watts or 12, but completely ignore large ticket items such as if a computer takes 200 watts or 1600 watts, same for many other devices (TVs, microwaves, stoves, etc). Complete nonsense.

"The tech called about 9:30 am and said he'd be here soon for the 3 meters to be repaired.  Showed up in driveway, didn't call to say he was here, sat in their vehicle for about 10 minutes and left.  Never entered the premises, did not fix any of the three meters, did not call me.  Called NG, waited about 35 minutes to be conected to a human, asked them why tech left?  is he coming back?  Answer was - no he just read the meters from his vehicle.  Said someone changed the order from meter repair to meter read.  The last order for meter repair was confirmed at 6:30 pm previous night so my guess is this tech decided not to do the work and changed the order after he showed up.  Now we have to have someone wait again on another day for another tech to come and repair/change the 3 defective meters that haven't been reading for months, all over again.",3,Billing,Very Negative,1,Webster,,March 2025,3/26/2025 3:48:00 PM,"Tuesday, March 25, 2025"

"The technician who responded to our emergency call on the afternoon of Monday, May 5th, to repair leaks in the line outside, before the meter told us that leaks between the meter and our home were to be repaired by our gas plumber but said IT WAS NOT AN EMERGENCY and NEVER ADViSED us that we had ONLY FIVE DAYS TO MAKE THAT REPAIR, neither did the service tag that he left, indicating a âCâ situation.

On Tuesday May 6th, two technicians arrived to change our meter. At no time did either of them inform us of the five day rule, nor did they indicate that a repair needed to be made ASAP.

This could have been avoided had we been properly advised of the five day period.

"The worker accidentally dropped the F-bomb after noticing he forgot to turn the basement light off. He immediately apologized saying, ""pardon my French!"" I said, ""That's not French, but it's OK"" and then offered some words in French to make light of the situation as he went down the stairs to fix it. While the F-bomb didn't shock me and was NOT directed at me...my mother would be horrified (she's deeply religious). So, it did strike me as being unprofessional. Maybe some CULTURAL training would be helpful. Someone who equates the F-word with the French (people) language, may also use other outdated phrases that disparage other groups of people. Perhaps some training to manage on-the-job frustration, but maybe something personal was going on. I know I've had to continue working after hearing about a death in the family, awaiting lab results that could've been a fatal diagnosis (wasn't), etc. BUT, I also know that I have a responsibility to maintain a professional appearance while representing the brand. ALSO: The technician did NOT warn me that changing out the gas meter would mean that there would be a faint odor of gas. This isn't a problem for most people, but I have two medical conditions affecting my respiratory system, including an accidental chemical inhalation injury that has permanently left me hypersensitive and hyper-responsive to chemical fumes and vapors, including synthetic fragrances and chemically-scented products.

When i got the first letter, i set up an appointment for NG to come. They did and we both realized that the meter for my address (277 Railroad Avenue, ground floor) is in my neighbor's basement. That should be reflected in my account so new tenants and everyone is aware. I dont like getting letters re fines when I pay my bill on time and allow them access to my basement.

"They found my meter to be stuck reading thousands, instead of hundreds. They replaced the meter. The reason they came out was not so much that I was being over charged, but the system was withholding a payment, and then doubling them up. So randomly I see that national grid charged me nearly $500. I go in and check the bill and there is a missed payment and then a doubled up payment. I then call and speak with a representative that proceeds to tell me that auto pay has to be renewed yearly, or it will stop processing transactions. I have been a customer for 12 years at this address and this has never come up before. So, after the phone call, I log in to check my auto pay and it's currently due to end by the year 2099.

This comment is not about this particular service rep. But I had called about the problem in early 2023 and apparently the wrong work order was put in so no one did anything. I called in early 2024 and was told I needed to be home for the service and we set up a date. I took off work to be home. No one came. About 2 weeks later I came home to a door tag that someone had been by to do the work (no phone call!). I had to call to set up another time. I asked the service rep on the phone what to do if no one showed again and the answer was âcall us at 4 and we can work on getting someone out there that day.â Honestly that was a ridiculous notion that the work order that was put in was somehow not sufficient to get someone to the house. I received no insights into why the appointment that was made in 2024 was a complete no-show with no followup. If I had just chosen to not be home when I said I would be for the tech Iâm sure there would have been consequences. The tech who came was great and very friendly. Only minor issue is he gave about 3 minutes warning by phone that he was on his way. Thankfully I wasnât running home from work to meet him so it was fine.,,Call Ahead,Very Negative,5,Utica,DAVID EDIC,April 2024,4/14/2024 12:22:26 PM,"Wednesday, April 10, 2024"

On September 4 a fire occurred on the property behind my house that was a venue barn. Had nothing to do with my electric or bill. But my account was closed. I called to alert the company that a mistake had been made with my account this was October. Thought it was taken care of but when I checked the account still no bill. December 15 still no bill. Again called company again was told my house had a fire an account was closed. Again reported not my house, house is fine no fire. Came out to check my meter made sure I had a meter and checked meter number.

"This was an unattended enabling of VTOU.  Other than the clocks showing a power failure, there was no evidence of a visit at all, so far as I could tell (nobody home at the time).  Indeed, I don't even know whether the VTOU was enabled ... other than via the survey emails.

Note: Beforehand, I got an email from Kevin Arnold, letting me know of the upcoming service ...  and that it didn't require us to be home.  Thanks, Kevin!

So: I'm marking this as Satisfied because there was no confirmation of service (hang tag on the doorknob, email, phone call, whatever).  That's ok, assuming that VTOU actually *was* enabled... but with some kind of notification, I'd have given it a ""Highly Satisfied.""

I was threatened to have my electricity shut off all because someone from national grid didnât show up to the first appointment and they blamed it on me. I live in an apartment complex. My meter is under control of the complex, not myself, but I was the one receiving all of the correspondence and trying to direct national grid to the proper people to talk to. I was refused a direct call back number because  the âvoicemail system is downâ. That seems doubtful to me. This should be on my file that I live in an apartment and they should be the ones handling these situations. I also donât know why someone had to come into my apartment directly when I was told it was an issue with my meter. I never received any notice afterwards of any reports or findings. I donât even know what the actual issue was. My apartment was left a mess with my belongings thrown all over the place. This was all handled highly unprofessionally and I am very dissatisfied with my experience.",2,Safety & Reliability,Very Negative,2,Syracuse,ANTHONY NAPPI,March 2025,3/30/2025 6:03:23 PM,"Wednesday, March 26, 2025"

"Tiana and Bill were so wonderful and knowledgeable. They were able to answer questions that customer service reps were either not able to answer. Or gave me the wrong information. 
Both field reps were fantastic and I have no complaints. 
Some constructive criticism about customer service reps: 1. Getting ahold of customer service takes forever, you have to listen to a long automated message about things youâve already heard, or arenât relevant. There is no way to skip this. There is no direct line. The first rep I spoke with seemed very knew and gave me incorrect information, he tried his best but itâs always better to say I donât know, let me check on that than it is to just guess. He also hung up on me instead of transferring me. I think this was an honest mistake but it was still frustrating given the fact that I had to go through the above mentioned annoyingly long automated message before speaking to another rep. The second person that I spoke with was very helpful and stated that I did not have to have the meter removed, I could just have a pin put in (I think, I could be mis remembering) her knowledge was very helpful but somehow it seems there was still a work order to remove the meter. Luckily I spoke with Tiana and Bill who cleared everything up wonderfully.",,Billing,Mixed,5,Troy,TIANA JONES,November 2023,11/29/2023 11:55:08 PM,"Tuesday, November 28, 2023"

But gosh,national grid as a whole thing? Itâs a joke and you guys think we are the clowns. 
Never been so miss treated for a company before,all the people gave me one information,and the manager (that btw would never talk to me if I wasnât super insistent - I was waiting for his call since 7AM,and I just was able to talk to him around 5PM,and thatâs only cuz I was making his workerâs life really hard) well he said pretty much that EVERYTHING that the other people told me werenât correct,said there was nothing he could do for me,and when thereâs an appt he canât change. Interesting and funny that he found a way to change my appt when I said I was going to submit his name and everything that happened to better business bureau
I have a medical letter,I NEEDED the energy,had a bunch of insulin that literally was wasted cuz of this situation! 
Never never would have your service again if I had an option,the manager should learn a bit more on how to work with the public too! Instead of saying that his workers gave me wrong info,I spoke to at least 4/5 different people,everyone said that w the medical letter,I would have the energy turn on in 24H. Took me at least 72h to have it back,and I even had to listen from the manager why i didnât call it earlier if I needed it,none of his business what happened in my life that made me call at that moment! Ofc I wouldnât choose live all that stressed if I could! 
Bad bad bad that resume my experience all a whole! 
I hope whoever is reading this can go back to the calls and listening to everything. And that something happens!
Still going talk to better business bureau,so hopefully things change and other ppl can have a better experience than me and my family.",,Connect/Turn On,Mixed,3,Syracuse,MATTHEW KINNEY,August 2024,8/6/2024 1:06:09 PM,"Monday, August 5, 2024"
